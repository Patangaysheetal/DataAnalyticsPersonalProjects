# Covid-19 Dashboard- Personal Project

This repository contains a personal project where I developed an interactive **Covid-19 dashboard** using **Advanced Excel**, **SQL** on **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**, and **Tableau**. The project analyzes two datasets sourced from Kaggle: **Covid Deaths** and **Covid Vaccines**, providing insightful visualizations on global trends.

## Technologies and Tools Used

### 1. Advanced Excel
I used advanced Excel functions to:
- Clean, organize, and filter the raw Covid-19 data.
- Handle missing values and perform initial data analysis before importing it into SQL Server.

### 2. Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
SQL was used for:
- **Data Integration**: Combining and joining the **Covid Deaths** and **Covid Vaccines** datasets.
- **Data Querying**: Writing complex queries to extract meaningful insights about Covid-19 trends, vaccination progress, and death rates.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and handled data integrity issues.

### 3. Tableau
Tableau was used to create an interactive dashboard with key features:
- **Global Covid-19 Death Trends**: Visualizes the total number of deaths by country and region over time.
- **Vaccination Progress**: Tracks vaccine distribution and coverage across different countries.
- **Death and Vaccine Correlation**: Provides insights into the relationship between vaccination rates and Covid-19 death trends.

## Features of the Dashboard

- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter the data by region, country, and date range.
- **Visualization of Death Rates**: Bar charts and line graphs to depict Covid-19 death rates globally.
- **Vaccine Distribution Maps**: Geographic visualizations to track vaccine rollouts across countries.
- **Correlation Insights**: Analyze the correlation between vaccination rates and the reduction in death rates.

## Datasets

The datasets used for this project were sourced from Kaggle:
- **Covid Deaths Dataset**: Contains data on Covid-19 deaths across various countries and regions.
- **Covid Vaccines Dataset**: Includes data on vaccine distribution and administration by country.

## Development Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered the Covid-19 deaths and vaccines datasets from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the datasets using Excel and SQL, handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
3. **Data Integration**: Combined the two datasets using SQL to create a comprehensive view of Covid-19 trends.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Built interactive visualizations in Tableau to provide a clear and user-friendly interface for analyzing the data.
5. **Testing and Validation**: Ensured the accuracy of the data and functionality of the dashboard.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Tableau**: Make sure you have Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public installed.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. **Set Up SQL Server**: Import the datasets into **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** (SSMS) and run the provided SQL scripts to query the data.
4. **Open the Tableau Dashboard**: Open the Tableau workbook files (`.twbx`) included in the repository to explore the interactive Covid-19 dashboard.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, clean and process data using Excel and SQL, and create insightful visualizations in Tableau. The Covid-19 dashboard serves as a tool for tracking global trends in death rates and vaccination progress, providing users with interactive insights.
